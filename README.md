# cmm_logs_regex_extraction
Holds code for extracting the sales line ID and attributes from log files generated by PIInspect app

This code is used to open each .log file in a given directory and search for occurances for a sales line ID - a 10-digit integer beginning with '563'.  The code exploits the predictable name format of the log files to extract attributes based on the file name.  The results are written to a dataframe, which is written out to a csv file.
